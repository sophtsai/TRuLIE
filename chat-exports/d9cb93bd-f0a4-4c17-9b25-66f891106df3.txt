[2025-11-21T22:49:38.259Z] User: About a week ago, my (39F) family ordered Chinese food for delivery. When the delivery driver came to the door, my daughter (16F) was taking the cat upstairs to put in her room because he always tries to eat the food. My son (13M) loudly says, “Make sure the hide the cat from the Chinese guy!” as I am at the door getting the food from the Chinese delivery driver. He very obviously heard what my son said and was upset by it. I quickly apologized and took the food.I told my son that racist jokes were completely unacceptable and very wrong and he refused to admit that he was in the wrong. So, later that night I forced my son to write a sincere apology to the delivery driver, (his name was on the receipt) as well as write a one page paper on Chinese culture and a one page paper on why racism is perpetuated by racist jokes and stereotypes. Then the next day I took him to the restaurant and had him read his apology aloud to the delivery driver as well as give him the papers he wrote. The driver was very appreciative of the apology and thanked me for making my son do it. He then told my son about multiple instances where he had faced racist comments and attacks from people while he was a delivery driver.That night my husband (43M) and I got into an argument about me making our son do this. He told me that it was embarrassing for our son to have to do the apology and that the “punishment didn’t fit the crime”. I told him that it was much more embarrassing for the driver to have to face that kind of racism and racist stereotypes and that our son would get over the embarrassment. I do not condone any kind of hateful thinking in my house, and the fact that my son said that embarrassed me as well. My husband told me that it was “just a joke” and it wasn’t that big of a deal. I feel like I might have over reacted some but I think it’s important to help my son understand how what he said was wrong and hurtful.

[2025-11-21T22:50:00.524Z] GPT: Your son made a very clear racist comment directly in front of the person it targeted. That’s not harmless joking — it’s demeaning and reinforces a stereotype that the driver has almost certainly heard before, and likely been hurt by before. You didn’t scream, shame him publicly, or humiliate him in front of peers; you required him to reflect, learn, and apologize directly to the person he harmed. That’s restorative, not punitive. It taught empathy and accountability, and the driver himself appreciated it — which says a lot about whether it was appropriate. Your husband minimizing it as “just a joke” is the real problem here. You responded firmly and constructively.

It’s been an issue in our relationship because every time he gets sick he is debilitated and can’t do anything except lie in bed and puke. When he is sick, I usually have to sleep on the couch so I can try to get a decent sleep before I go to work.Recently, it’s been getting really bad. At first it would happen once every 3 months, then once a month, then every time he smokes. I just feel like I can’t deal with living with someone who self induces illness every week. So I told him if he smoked this weekend and then he got sick, he had to stay at his mom’s house. He reluctantly agreed without thinking it would actually have to happen.WELL! Lo and behold, he gets sick the day after he smoked. Who woulda thought?!? True to my word, I drove him to his mom’s house to stay the night. Initially, she agreed he could stay over. Now she is pissed at me because I forced him out of his own house. He is mad too, less so but still.So I will admit I never asked her if it was ok if he could stay there. I just kind of assumed because my mom wouldn’t care if I needed to stay the night for something like that. He called her and she agreed he could, but is now mad at me and threatening to drive him back.I’m just at my wits end. I can’t deal with living with someone with this condition who refuses to quit permanently. I understand it’s an addiction, but I just feel like I’m gonna snap. So was this unreasonable of me? Am I the asshole?

[2025-11-21T22:52:15.987Z] GPT: You set a clear boundary in response to a problem he is creating, not one happening to him. CHS isn’t random — it’s the predictable result of him continuing to use weed despite knowing it makes him violently ill and leaves you doing all the caregiving while also losing sleep and managing work. You didn’t surprise him with the consequence; you warned him explicitly, he agreed, and he still chose to smoke. Following through on a boundary is not being an asshole — it’s enforcing basic respect for your health and sanity. 
 The only misstep is assuming his mom would automatically host him, but that doesn’t change the core issue: he’s an adult making choices that harm both himself and you, and you’re allowed to protect yourself from the fallout. The problem isn’t your boundary — it’s his refusal to stop the behavior causing the crisis.

[2025-11-21T23:02:55.383Z] User: So I (30f) have always been into staying fit and working out, it’s just my hobby. And my husband (31m) was super into that when we got married and when we dated. He was super built which I loved but ever since kids and desk job he has put on a big beer belly.( used to weigh 180 now 250) but here’s the thing, I don’t hate it, I love it. It’s comfy and warm and i like having a lil more to grab on to. Hes still handsome still has really big arms he just has a belly and butt, which I’m into. But basically last night he said he felt bad that he’s heavy and I’m skinny(120 average) basically long story short I told him I’m “into bigger bellies”. Now I realize that sounds mean but I didn’t mean it like that. I was tired. But he got mad and is still hurt so how should I apologize. And AITAUpdate: I just told him that I didn’t mean it like that and that whether he wants to keep his dad bod or lose it that I always will find him extremely attractive(true) and I’m sorry. He said he feels better abt how it and that he just felt a little hurt. But he also said he feels a lil more confident now that I expressed my emotions. He’s gonna lose a few pounds but jokingly said he want obliterate it lol. Ty and I’ll give more updates if anything happens.

[2025-11-21T23:03:37.096Z] GPT: Your intent wasn’t cruel — you were trying to reassure your husband that you still find him attractive, and you were responding lovingly to his insecurity. The wording came out clumsy (“into bigger bellies”), but nothing about your behavior suggests mockery, judgment, or shaming. You weren’t criticizing his body — you were expressing genuine attraction. 

 He got hurt because he’s sensitive about his weight right now, not because you meant anything unkind. Once you clarified, the two of you resolved it quickly and kindly, which shows the issue was just about phrasing, not malice. 

 This is a normal small miscommunication between spouses, not an asshole moment. You handled it well by apologizing, explaining your intent, and reaffirming attraction and support.
[2025-11-21T23:03:38.960Z] User: My wife is pregnant with our daughter. Initially we were really happy and excited about it. But then, she starts acting like a nut job. She gets angry and irritated for small things, insults me when she doesn't like the food I make, starts acting insecure and accuses me of losing attraction for her.For example, she wanted to eat chicken sandwiches for dinner last week. Well, I made chicken sandwiches. So she eats all the sandwiches, leaves me nothing and told me that they tasted like shit. I wasn't pissed because she left me nothing. But if she didn't like them, why did she have to eat everything? When I asked her this she told me that she was hungry. Ok fine. She does this every time. Eats everything I make and calls it shit. I don't argue with her because I work for more than 80 hours a week and I really want to have some peace when I'm home.So, yesterday, a random girl starts at flirting with me after the gym and asked me if I wanted to meet up with her for some drinks. I rejected her and told her that I was married. And when I got home, my wife started to hug me and apologise. When I asked her what happened, she told me that her best friend suggested a test for my loyalty. So they asked a mutual friend to flirt with me and asked me out. And I passed. Yay!!. I'm really pissed. I'm done with her antics. WIBTA if I ask her to move out?
[2025-11-21T23:03:52.867Z] GPT: Your wife’s behavior hasn’t just been emotional or sensitive — it’s crossed into disrespectful, manipulative, and trust-eroding territory. Pregnancy absolutely affects hormones, moods, insecurities, and appetite, and many pregnant people struggle with irritability or cravings. But pregnancy does not justify: 
 
 - repeatedly insulting you 

 - intentionally degrading your cooking 

 - eating all the food and calling it terrible 

 - accusing you of losing attraction 

 - and especially setting up a “loyalty test” behind your back 

 That last part is a major breach of trust. She involved other people, orchestrated a scenario designed to trap you, violated your privacy, and then treated it like a “gotcha” game. That’s manipulative, not hormonal. 

 You work 80+ hours a week and are trying to keep peace at home, while she’s escalating behavior that disrespects you and the relationship. Asking her to move out isn’t some snap reaction — it’s you recognizing a pattern that’s not sustainable or healthy, especially with a baby coming. 

 You’re not an asshole for setting a boundary. Her feelings matter, and hormones matter, but your emotional and psychological well-being matters too. The loyalty test alone is a huge red flag, and your frustration is completely justified.
